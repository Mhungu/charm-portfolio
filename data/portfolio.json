From cinnamon rolls, to chairs, I love translating the ideas and concepts in my head into real life. Learning new tools and fabrication processes is one of my favorite parts of being a design student. Outside of class, I enjoy baking (my favorites right now are cinnamon rolls and brown butter chocolate chip cookies), hiking, and singing.
