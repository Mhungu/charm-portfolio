My name is Charmelle Mhungu and I am a 3rd year design student at MIT passionate about hands-on learning and making. From cinnamon rolls, to chairs, I love translating the ideas and concepts in my head into real life. Learning new tools and fabrication processes is one of my favorite parts of being a design student. I am also minoring in Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies, as I am passionate about making design more accessible for all. Outside of class, I enjoy baking (my favorites right now are cinnamon rolls and brown butter chocolate chip cookies), hiking, and singing. I am on the Black Studentsâ€™ Union (BSU) and National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) exec as I love to plan events that foster community, especially with food (I love to eat with my community)!!","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
