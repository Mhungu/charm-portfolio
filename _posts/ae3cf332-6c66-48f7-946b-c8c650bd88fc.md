# Concept

This assignment was focused on precision in our representation of our specific
Polaroid. This did not necessarily mean complete accuracy; however, it meant the representation must correctly capture the full essence of your camera. In the drawing, the importance was not just in what was chosen to include, but also what to overemphasize and what to omit. I was given a photograph of the front, side, and top view of the camera, using those three views I made the oblique projection view in the bottom right.

I believe what makes the Polaroid 600 so recognizable is the retractable flashbar, so I wanted my drawing to center this iconic piece of the camera.
