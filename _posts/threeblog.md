# Concept

In his book *Autoprogettazione* (which roughly translates to Self-Design), Enzo Mari talks of the consumer also being involved in the design and fabrication of products in order to become more critical of the objects one buys. In Mariâ€™s eyes, design needs to respond honestly to human needs. He actually lays out several (relatively) simple designs for furniture pieces such as chairs, tables, and dressers in his book for the reader to get involved with making. We wanted to emulate how Enzo Mari originally wanted the chair to be made, so we did not use any power tools or machines.

# Fabrication

The entire chair was made by using a Dozuki panel saw (also called a Japanese duck saw), hammer, and nails. The plans consisted of a side, front, and back view of the chair with the lengths of the pieces of wood. Much of the building process relied on using your own intuition to decide where exactly each piece should go.
