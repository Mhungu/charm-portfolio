  I designed this video game controller to be difficult to hold and challenge
  the user to press the buttons corresponding to the colors shown on the screen
  (think of Twister but just for your hands).

# Concept

For this project we created a 1-D game and a custom human-interface device (HID), or in other words, a video game controller for controlling it. We started with the concept for our game, similar to Twister but for your hands. Three colors would appear on the screen and the player needs to find and press the 3 corresponding colors on the controller for 5 seconds to win the round. If this player does not find the right colors in 10 seconds, then they lose the round. The kicker? The controller is specifically designed to make it difficult for the player to find, press, and hold the buttons. I was inspired by the different patterns many coral create overtime as they build into a coral reef. These [patterns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcreativity103.com%2Fcollections%2FAquascape%2Fslides%2Ffaviidae_boulder_coral.html&psig=AOvVaw2Tcj9fny_8wpK_RnISKFHG&ust=1725136460636000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCMDCrKPInYgDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) created divots for the buttons to reside and made for an object that is disorienting to the player. 


# Fabrication

I began prototyping on the form of our controller in clay because from the beginning, we wanted our physical object to be an abstract, yet organic shape.

We liked the look of the clay object and once we finalized the shape of our object, we 3-D scanned our clay object then imported and repaired the mesh in Rhino to later Nylon-Powder print the controller and buttons.

We used starter code based on a simple 1-D video game in JavaScript and p5js and made several adjustments to the base code to make our game. For the electronics, we used an Arduino and a simple circuit attached to the 9 total buttons on the video game controller.
