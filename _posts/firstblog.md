# Concept

A representation of the Simmons building focusing on resolution in 3D, but with a new medium. Using fast-curing Rockite we experimented with many ways of making the molds and many different scales of models. When presenting our Simmons 3-D Models Our concept sprung from the idea of making a Simmons souvenir that is universally symmetrical from all sides. While we maintained some of the more iconic parts of the Simmons building, it is not as instantly recognizable as our earlier representation [here](http://localhost:3000/blog/secondblog).


# Fabrication

We originally used scraps of sheet metal and PLA pieces to make the large 5” x 5” x 5” cube, however, this was too much Rockite to cast at once, which is why there is a stratification of the different layers of Rockite.

We then used laser-cut Masonite and foam to make 1/8 sections of a larger 6” x 6” x 6” Simmons cube that would be stackable. This helped us get crisp edges and deep indents, but was not great for specific detailing.

We ultimately used 3D-printed molds (and a bucket load of Vaseline) to make the 2.5” x 2.5” x 2.5” cube with the iconic Simmons detailing. We first printed the designs of the 6 faces we wanted and then we made an outside box to hold the 6 faces in place as the concrete hardened.
