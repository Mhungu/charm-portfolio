  Tasked with making a working lamp using 1.25" x 1.25" wooden planks and a
  simple set of design rules, we wanted our lamp to emulate the work of Maurtis
  Escher and look as if its existence should be impossible.

# Concept

Birthed from a prompt inspired by Enzo Mari's *Autoprogettazione*, we were asked to create a lamp based on a set of simple design instructions. For our design, we were inspired by Maurits Escher's "impossible" constructions, such as his pieces [*Relativity*](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=e286eb43f4ef8551&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWIKOB3GO9Jajf3TotfTRmn4_W6tZIA:1725042945230&q=relativity+escher&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0AVbySjNxIXoj6bNaq7uSpw-2eW7KIQ8H4T_tEPJYsPzOi5GKsV0RKGmy84LfyUxrl-4_0AusV0IdjeUAdX2KBg7BmnGLOak5d-z-_u-BD5mANqasZxTMen5uZGRcW3Asxblx5Q1OYqkbmwkXLBzqCwgdzwtvZKVFrUj4v_fdTR68ZFGhx48b8eVoqoZU1-F3aJ5DD9pJyvzF_j7l0x84J8mAwSfQ&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjf0OPfrZ2IAxXsElkFHc1qLGgQtKgLegQIChAB&biw=1230&bih=659&dpr=1.25) and [*Waterfall*](https://www.google.com/search?q=waterfall+escher&sca_esv=e286eb43f4ef8551&sca_upv=1&udm=2&biw=1230&bih=659&sxsrf=ADLYWIJuYMQHw56iOXBtYNMAfFBi1DPdhg%3A1725042947737&ei=AxHSZufiLNLdptQP14700Qw&ved=0ahUKEwin8PzgrZ2IAxXSrokEHVcHPcoQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=waterfall+escher&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEHdhdGVyZmFsbCBlc2NoZXIyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGAcYHjIGEAAYBxgeMgYQABgHGB4yBhAAGAgYHjIGEAAYCBgeMgYQABgIGB4yBhAAGAgYHkjiC1AAWJMKcAB4AJABAJgBVqAB1ASqAQE5uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIJoAKiBcICCBAAGAUYBxgewgIIEAAYBxgIGB6YAwCSBwE5oAeOPQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp), as well as impossible objects, such as the [penrose triangle](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcults3d.com%2Fen%2F3d-model%2Fart%2Ftriangulo-imposible-perspectiva-matematicas-y-ciencia-parecido-a-escher-o-penrose&psig=AOvVaw1cZm3_9-MBBrXbVLOcqkUC&ust=1725129999156000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCODUzZywnYgDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). We wanted our rules to be simple, yet compelling enough to make interesting objects no matter how one decided to follow them, so we decided on:
1. The lamp must be composed of one continuous line
2. Every joint in the lamp must meet at 90Â°


# Fabrication

Our rules brought about many different drawings of lamp objects, however, many of them either did not stand upright or could not physically exist.

When we decided on our final design, we made a Rhino model to finalize measurements and to work with the constraints of our material, 1.5inx1.5in birch wooden dowels. Actually making the lamp was a slightly complicated process, because each of our 26 pieces are connected not just by miter joints, but also dominoes to secure those joints. After multiple rounds of gluing and clamping, I handled all the electronics of the lamp, soldering the led strips into the table-sawed slots.

For finishing touches, we added yupo acrylic to help diffuse the harsh lights of the LED strips, and oiled the lamp to bring out the natural patterning of the wood.
