  This project was a representation of the Simmons building focusing on
  resolution in 3D. We made two models, one approximately the size of grapefruit
  (6x1x2 in.) and one approximately the size of a walnut (2x0.5x1 in).

# Concept

Resolution in architecture and design is a relative term describing the amount of information in a given description, e.g. low-resolution vs high-resolution images. Questions of resolution will be both an act of design and a negotiation with specific methods, scales, and materials. The project will include a series of sub-assignments that develop sequentially and progress from 2D to 3D. Following previous explorations in 2D using spray paint, we completely shifted not only to a new medium, but also a whole new scope of space. This project was a representation of the Simmons building focusing on resolution in 3D.  We made two models, one approximately the size of grapefruit (6” x 1” x 2”) and one approximately the size of a walnut (2” x 1/2” x 1”). Both models were 3D printed with powder printing to have the highest resolution possible, however, we simplified many parts of the building. We were interested in exploring what makes Simmons recognizable through seeing how much one could simplify the building, yet still maintain the essence of Simmons Hall.

# The Grapefruit Model

For the grapefruit model, we decided that the top outline and numerous windows were the most integral parts of the essence of Simmons. We had 10 windows in each column to represent the 10 stories of Simmons and although this is a simplification of the real Simmons, it provided a simple parameterization of the building as we were making the model.

# The Walnut model

For the walnut model, due to its incredibly small size, we decided to omit most of Simmons' windows and instead exaggerated the few oddly shaped windows. This helped to mimic the “porous” look of the original building, without the need to overload the model with too many details. We used the same top outline of the building as the grapefruit model which gave the model the final “Simmons touch” it needed.
